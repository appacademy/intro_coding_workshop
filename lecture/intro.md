### What is Programming?

When you write a computer program, you are telling your computer how to do something. As a programmer, your job is to take a larger task and break it down into smaller tasks. You then break down these smaller tasks further until you get to the simplest, most basic tasks that the computer already understands.

The first language you'll be learning at App Academy is **Ruby**

### Why Ruby?

Ruby is an elegant programming language perfect for anyone who is beginning to code. It is also powerful and expressive, which makes it a great choice for advanced programmers.
