### Pair Programming

+ Definition: two programmers work together at one workstation
+ Roles
  * **Navigator** directs the driver on what to type
  * **Driver** types at the keyboard and executes navigator's commands
+ Communication is key!
  * it is okay to disagree, but make sure to respect your partner enough
  to understand their thought process
+ Switch roles every fifteen minutes!
  * I personally always used Google timer

What to note verbally:

Benefits of Pair Programming

1. Pairs are a second pair of eyes. Since most novice mistakes are
   trivial, your pair has a greater chance of immediately identifying
   a problem that could have otherwise taken you a long time to
   discover.
2. Every student will learn different things outside of class; pairing
   is a way to bring that knowledge back into the class and share it
   with other students. This is one of the reasons we have new pairs
  for every project; we want everyone to benefit from everyone else's
  experience.
3. It is important to maintain focus throughout the class day. Working
   solo, it is easy to become distracted or zone out. Working in
   pairs, students help keep each other honest.
4. Working with other people is fun; we do a lot of coding, and it
   ought to be enjoyable.

## Pitfalls of Pair Programming

If one of you is typing while the other quietly watches, you are doing
it wrong.

1. Use the timer to schedule switches. You must switch; each partner
   must have equal time in both roles.
2. Drivers must not go off and start typing on their own, they must
   follow the navigators' instructions. Avoid being a domineering
   driver.
3. Likewise, the navigator must be engaged, must ask plenty of
   questions, and must be comfortable making suggestions. Avoid being
   a passive navigator.

**If one of you is typing away and the other is passively watching,
you are both doing it wrong**.
